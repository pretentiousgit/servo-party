# servo-party
A repo of arduino sketches for cap touch control and servo movement


### Using This Repository
You will require a basic, no-frills Arduino environment for this repo. Contained within it are three sketches: 
* ADCTouchDemo
  * This is a basic demonstration of the ADC Touch library, which we will be using to drive our servos to dance.
* ADCTouch_NeoPixels
  * A fun sketch that has nothing whatsoever to do with servos! Ask me for some lights, though, and you can play with it.
* ADCTouch_Servo
  * A sketch to control a servo motor from a capacitive touch sensor
